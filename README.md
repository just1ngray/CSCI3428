Service Learning at Saint Mary's: (https://smu.ca/campus-life/service-learning.html)
=================================
Course-Based Service Learning is an experiential learning approach which links community-based experience 
with course content. Service Learning involves a range of activities intended to benefit the service 
provider (the student) and the recipient (the community partner) while maintaining a focus on learning. At 
Saint Mary's University, various approaches and types of assignments are adopted in courses which include 
service learning components. Students participate in unpaid service experience, which is in addition to regular 
class hours, and complete assignments which incorporate reflection about their experiences. Sometimes services 
learning is an optional assignment, but it may also be a required element of a course.
